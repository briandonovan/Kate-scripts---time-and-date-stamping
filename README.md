## Synopsis

This script provides date-and-time-stamp insertion for [The Kate Editor](https://kate-editor.org/).

## Keyboard shortcuts

* `Ctrl+Alt+d` inserts a date and time of the form `20170312 15:01` at the current cursor position.

* `Ctrl+Alt+t` inserts a date and time of the form `Wednesday, April 12, 2017 22:58:04` at the current cursor position.

Keyboard shortcuts are specified in the `katescript` object literal at the top of the file, so changing them is quick and easy.

## Installation

Place a copy of this script in your `katepart5\script\commands` directory, which turns out to be `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\katepart5\script\commands` on my WIndows 10 system (YMMV), and (re)start Kate. It should therafter be usable via its keyboard shortcuts and through the Kate UIâ€”look in `Tools > Scripts > Brian's Utility Belt`.
